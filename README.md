The Stiffy Kit is a set of machined or printed parts to add MGN15 rails & MGN15H carriages to the top & bottom of the X module, the left & right sides of the Z modules, and associated brackets to join each module together to substantially stiffen up the rigidity of the Snapmaker 2.0 A350, to ultimately increase its CNCing capability.
